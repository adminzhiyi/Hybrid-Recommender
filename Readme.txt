This is a recommender code using a hybrid of content based filtering as well as collaborative filtering to recommend movies.
Store the code and the movie lens dataset provided in the same folder
To use download the following
 
Anaconda navigator
Create a new environment
Name it accordingly
open terminal of that environment by left clicking and choosing open terminal
conda install tensorflow
conda install surprise
 
then download spyder from anaconda navigator and open all the code files.
Use Hybrid test to see performance of RBM, content RNN and hybrid of both of them and predict movies using all three algorithms
(This process might take time depending on computational speed of your machine).
